## The mission of RawCMS

1. **Modular** Each module is shipped in a NuGet package that can be added to the system to gain new features
2. **Headless** RawCMS doesn't include any presentation logic. All presentation is delegated to the caller. This aims to create a scalable and reusable system
3. **Packaged** RawCMS must be shipped into a single deployable package or added into an existent ASP.NET core application as NuGet package.
4. **Extensible** RawCMS must be customized by the user through extension only. So, no changes to the code will be done. Just adding new packages.
5. **Buildless** RawCMS must give the possibility to manage an installation without the need to manage a codebase or a code repository. It will be possible to add lambdas code at runtime.
6. **Caller Friendly** Produce data in many formats to help integration (Odata, GraphQL)
