## Contribution

As every open source project, we are looking for contributors. Any kind of help is welcome. _Just a star on the project is a lot._ If you want to contribute as a developer, you can join the project by [filling out this form](https://forms.gle/dddbHWzcxypN9rpx9) or by opening an issue. Any other kind of contribution, from docs to tests, is also welcome.

## Try it

You can test RawCMS using the public [demo](http://rawcms-demo.herokuapp.com/) using the default credentials (username:bob, password:XYZ). **App run in a free tier, so it can take a little bit to come up.**

## Deploy it

You can deploy it using many options. RawCMS is dockerized from the development stage so modern hosting is fully supported.

1. _Docker Compose_ using the provided docker-compose file
2. _Kubernetes_ using the provided docker images
3. _Heroku_ using the provided images
4. _Virtual machines_ using the packages provided and deployed manually to the server

## The mission of RawCMS

1. **Modular**: Each module is shipped in a NuGet package that can be added to the system to gain new features
2. **Headless**: RawCMS doesn't include any presentation logic. All presentation is delegated to the caller. This aims to create a scalable and reusable system
3. **Packaged**: RawCMS must be shipped into a single deployable package or added into an existent ASP.NET Core application as a NuGet package.
4. **Extensible**: RawCMS must be customized by the user through extension only. So no changes to the code will be done, just adding new packages.
5. **Buildless**: RawCMS must give the possibility to manage an installation without the need to manage a codebase or a code repository. It will be possible to add lambdas code at runtime.
6. **Caller Friendly**: Produce data in many formats to help integration (Odata, GraphQL)

\***\*If you are interested in contributing just open an issue to start a conversation. Help wanted.\*\***
