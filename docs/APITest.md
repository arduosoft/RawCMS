# API Test

Test of API are implementend in the postman collection. Each request comes with the test script. What you need to do is run the test suite manually as follows:

1. Open Postman Runner from file menu
2. Select the collection
3. Start

The first request gets the token using bob's credential, and this user is part of the data seed.

Tests are processed in the sequential order, so POST request has to be done BEFORE GET if you want to save data then check otherwise its OK
